- [‚¨ÜÔ∏è Deployment](#Ô∏è-deployment)

## üèÑ Get Started

Clone project and setup environment variables:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/df-web.git
cd df-web/

# copy and setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

Then start the development version of the app by using either Docker, or your local system:

```bash
# using Docker
docker-compose up

# or using local system
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:4005](http://localhost:4005). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

You may also need to update the following files to configure your environment:

- Update `address.json` inside `src/utils/addresses/` w/ [the latest contract address.json file generated by our build system](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/addresses/address.json). If you are building locally using Barge, your address.json file should be somewhere in the OCEAN_HOME directory `~/.ocean/ocean-contracts/artifacts/address.json`
- If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## üõ≥ Production

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Deployment

Every Pull Request gets its own preview build via Vercel's GitHub integration.

The `main` branch is always deployed to [df-web-oceanprotocol.vercel.app](df-web-oceanprotocol.vercel.app).

Live deployments happen...
