- [🏄 Get Started](#-get-started)
- [🛳 Production](#-production)
- [⬆️ Deployment](#️-deployment)


## 🏄 Get Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

Setup [environment variables](#environment-variables), then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

You may also need to update the following files in code to configure your environment:

- Update `address.json` inside `src/utils/addresses/` w/ [the latest contract address.json file generated by our build system](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/addresses/address.json). If you are building locally using Barge, your address.json file should be somewhere in the OCEAN_HOME directory `~/.ocean/ocean-contracts/artifacts/address.json`
- If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## 🛳 Production

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

## ⬆️ Deployment

Every Pull Request gets its own preview build via Vercel's GitHub integration.

The `main` branch is always deployed to [df-web-88kg.vercel.app](https://df-web-88kg.vercel.app).

Live deployments happen...
